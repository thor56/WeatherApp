# Weather App

## Project Overview

This project is a simple weather app that allows users to enter a city and get the current weather. The app also provides a 5-day forecast and uses icons to display the weather information in a visually appealing way. This project was completed as part of the Software Engineer Intern - AI/ML Application Tech Assessment by Product Manager Accelerator Program.

## Features

* Get current weather by city
* 5-day forecast
* Weather icons for visual representation
* User location-based weather (optional)

## Technology Stack

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js
* APIs: OpenWeatherMap API

## Why We Did It

I built this weather app as part of the tech assessment to demonstrate my skills in building a simple yet functional web application. I chose to use Node.js and Express.js for the backend to showcase my ability to work with JavaScript and APIs. I also used OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data.
